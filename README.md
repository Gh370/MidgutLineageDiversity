# MidgutLineageDiversity
Important codes and data for "Mapping high-resolution cell phylogenies reveals age-dependent loss of lineage diversity in the *Drosophila* midgut".

## code
The calculation process of obtaining effective population size and lineage diversity in midgut.

## data
Files with **annotation** in the filename are the annotations of the phylogenetic trees, which are about the numbers of mutaitons in the sampled readout sequences. The names of samples are derived from "Mapping high-resolution cell phylogenies reveals age-dependent loss of lineage diversity in the *Drosophila* midgut".
### IQ-TREE
Phylogenetic trees constructed using IQ-TREE that have been pruned.
### Phylotime
Time-scaled phylogenetic trees constructed by Phylotime.
 * Phylotime_WholeMidgut.RData: time-scaled phylogenetic trees of cell populations in whole midgut.
 * Phylotime_PosteriorMidgut.RData: time-scaled phylogenetic trees of intestinal stem cell population in posterior midgut.
