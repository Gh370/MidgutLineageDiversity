 * Taking the first sample obtained on day 3 (S1_3d) as an example, EffectivePopulationSize.R and LineageDiversity.R demonstrate how to calculate the effective population size (Ne) and lineage diversity.
 * The Ne_WholeMidgut_data.RData and Ne_PosteriorMidgut_data.RData files contain the Ne estimates for the entire midgut and the posterior midgut, respectively.
 * RandomForest.R illustrates how to fit representative curves of Ne across different time points using a random forest model, using the samples from day 3 as an example.
 * Simulation.R provides the simulation code for the random forest-based framework for estimating effective population size trends, as demonstrated in Supplementary Note 1.
