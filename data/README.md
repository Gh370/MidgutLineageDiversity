For naming samples, the underscore is preceded by the serial number of samples and followed by the sampling time point.
For example, S1_3d indicates that the first sample of whole midgut is obtained on day 3. 
S1_P_33d indicates that the first sample of adult *Drosophila* posterior midgut is obtained on day 33.
